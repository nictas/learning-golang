# Learning Go

This repository serves as a collection of all the code I write while progressing through the Pluralsight courses on Golang. You can find the courses on the Pluralsight platform [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/channels/details/ff68da77-c5a6-461f-ba4c-8a6b6f3f1f68).

Each top-level directory corresponds to a specific course, and within those directories, you'll find subdirectories organized by chapters and videos. For instance, the code for video 5 of chapter 4 from the course "Go: The Big Picture" would be located in `/go-the-big-picture/5.4`.

This structure is designed to make it easy to follow along with the courses and quickly locate the relevant code for any specific topic or lesson.
